A blogger needs to get the year from a blog post date.

The Blog class has an instance variable date, which stores the date formatted as "MM/DD/YYYY".

✅ TO DO #1: In the Blog class, write the getYear() method to return a substring containing the year from the date.

✅ TO DO #2: In the BlogRunner class, call the getYear() method and print the result.

💡 TIP: Check out the documentation for the String class in the Documentation tab ⬆️ for help with using the substring() method.
