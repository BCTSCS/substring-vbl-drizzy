A store clerk needs to get the price from a product label.

The Product class has an instance variable label, which stores the name of the product and its price as a String (for example, "Apple: $9.99").

✅ TO DO #1: In the Product class, write the getPrice() method to return a substring containing the price from the instance variable label. For example, the method should return $9.99 from the label "Apple: $9.99".

💡 TIP: Use the indexOf() method to get the location of the $ in the String.
✅ TO DO #2: In the ProductRunner class, call the getPrice() method and print the result.

💡 TIP: Check out the documentation for the String class in the Documentation tab ⬆️ for help with using the substring() method.
