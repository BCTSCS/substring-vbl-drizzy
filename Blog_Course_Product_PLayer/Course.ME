A student wants to get the course number from a String containing the course name and number.

The Course class has an instance variable courseCode, which stores the course code formatted as "courseName-courseNumber".

✅ TO DO #1: In the Course class, write the getCourseNumber() method to return a substring containing the course number from the instance variable courseCode.

💡 TIP: Use the indexOf() method to get the location of the - in the String.
✅ TO DO #2: In the CourseRunner class, call the getCourseNumber() method and print the result.

💡 TIP: Check out the documentation for the String class in the Documentation tab ⬆️ for help with using the substring() method.
