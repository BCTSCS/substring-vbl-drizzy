A game developer wants to get a player's high score from a high score record.

The Player class has an instance variable record, which stores the player's name and high score as a String formatted as "Name - score".

✅ TO DO #1: In the Player class, write the getScore() method to return a substring that contains the score from the instance variable record.

💡 TIP: Use the indexOf() method to get the location of the - in the String.
✅ TO DO #2: In the PlayerRunner class, call the getScore() method and print the result.

💡 TIP: Check out the documentation for the String class in the Documentation tab ⬆️ for help with using the substring() method.
